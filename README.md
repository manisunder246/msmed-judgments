### MSMED Judgments Analysis Project

##### Project Overview
This project focuses on developing and comparing different information retrieval techniques using a corpus of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) judgments in India. The aim is to explore the effectiveness of Boolean retrieval using an inverted index, with and without stemming, and to analyze the impact of including document frequency in the retrieval process.

##### Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of 37 documents related to MSMED judgments in India and one summarizing some landmark judgements. These documents are in PDF format. They have been collected to demonstrate the construction and utility of an inverted index in the legal domain, specifically for MSMED cases.

##### Objectives:
1. To construct an inverted index with and without stemming for Boolean retrieval.
To enhance the inverted index with document frequency and analyze its impact.
To compare the effectiveness of these retrieval techniques using various metrics and visualizations.
To discuss the unique challenges and considerations encountered in processing and retrieving information from legal documents.

##### Repository Structure
- /docs: Contains all the MSMED judgment documents.
- /src: Source code for the information retrieval system.
- /data: Processed data and intermediate files used/generated by the code.
- /notebooks: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the analysis and comparisons.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

##### Tools and Technologies Used:
1. Python for data processing and analysis.
2. Libraries such as NLTK for text processing and stemming.
3. Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
4. Jupyter Notebook for interactive code execution and presentation.

##### How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the /notebooks directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks to view the code and results.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to run the analyses.
